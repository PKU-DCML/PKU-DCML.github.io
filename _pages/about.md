Welcome to the DCML Group in PKU!
We are part of the [Center of Machine Learning Research (CMLR)](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"} at [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"}. 
Together we enjoy working on **Data-centric Machine Learning**, **Graph Machine Learning**, 
**Machine Learning Systems**, and **Interdisciplinary Applications (e.g., AI4Science)**.

**<font color=red>We have opening positions for PhDs, Masters and Research Interns (not limited to PKU, work online). Interested persons please contact Prof.Wentao Zhang directly!</font>**
