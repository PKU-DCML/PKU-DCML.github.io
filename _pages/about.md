Welcome to the DAIR Lab!
We are part of the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"} at [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"}. 
Together we enjoy working on **Database**, **Machine Learning Systems**, **Data-centric Machine Learning**, and **AutoML**, etc.

DAIR is a research lab led by Professor [Cui Bin](https://cuibinpku.github.io/) from the School of Computer Science at Peking University. The lab has made significant contributions to theoretical and technological innovation, system research and development, and has published over 100 academic papers in top international academic conferences and journals. Additionally, it has undertaken multiple open-source projects. The lab has been recognized with numerous honors including Microsoft Fellowship, Apple Scholarship, Google Fellowship, and the PhD dissertation award from CCF, ACM China, and PKU. At last, the lab has also established fruitful collaborations with well-known enterprises such as Tencent, Alibaba, Apple, Microsoft, Baidu, Kwai, ZTE and others to solve practical problems and transform scientific research achievements.

**<font color=red>We have opening positions for Tenure-track faculties, Post-Docs and Interns. Interested persons please contact Prof.Bin Cui directly!</font>**
