Three research questions
---
+ **Q1**(DCML): How to improve the data quality and quantity for (graph) ML with low time and money costs?
+ **Q2**(ML Systems): How to make DCML easier and faster?
+ **Q3**(AI4Science): How to better apply DCML to the science community?


Welcome to the DCML Group in PKU!
Our group is led by [Prof.Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/), and we are part of the [Center of Machine Learning Research (CMLR)](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"} at [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"}. 
To solve the above three questions, we enjoy working on **Data-centric Machine Learning**, **Graph Machine Learning**, 
**Machine Learning Systems**, and **AI4Science**.

**<font color=red>We have opening positions for PhDs (2 students/year), Masters and Research Interns (not limited to PKU, work online). Interested persons please contact Prof.Wentao Zhang directly!</font>**
