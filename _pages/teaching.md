Teaching is one of our core contributions at PKU.
Besides sharing knowledge with new generations of computer scientists,
we value the insights and view of the continuously renewing student body on our disciplines.
Further, we enjoy close research collaboration with motivated students,
often performed as a thesis or in a intern position.
We invite you to join our [courses](#courses),
to write a [thesis](#theses) with us or to join our lab.

## Courses



## Theses

We offer Bachelor's for computer science students at PKU.
All topics are close to our ongoing research,
allowing you to work on hot topics
and to gain deeper insight into the field and our work.
As our work evolves, the topics change continuously.

Please enclose in your mail your research interests and experiences so far.
Knowing about your favorite courses, projects, and personal experience
helps us to find the right thesis topic for you.
